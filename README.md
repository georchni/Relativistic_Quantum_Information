# Relativistic-Quantum-Information


Abstract: The scope of this technical report is the review of multiple scientific papers regarding
Quantum Information and its behavior in the context of relativistic systems that demonstrate
unique mathematical properties. Such systems are certrain solutions of the Einstein Field Equations
like Scwarzchild’s metric, Gödel’s metric, closed time-like curves, traversable and non-traversable
wormholes, i.e. time machines.

This review was part of a Master's level seminar course offerred by the Chair of Scientific Computing, Faculty of Informatics at the Technical University of Munich.
